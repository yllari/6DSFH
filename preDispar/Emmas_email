Label = [-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,11,15,17,23,24 26,28] 

Name = ['Not Assigned','Gaia Enceladus', 'L-RL3', 'Hot Thick Disk', 'Thamnos 1+2', Helmi Streams', 'Sequoia', 'ED-1', 'L-RL64', 'ED-2', 'ED-4', 'ED-3', 'Typhon', 'ED-5', ED-6'] 

It is a 6D halo sample within 2.5 kpc, no quality cuts. It is simply Gaia RVS sample, with distance within 2.5 kpc and with a vtoomre>210 km/s (i.e. halo). 
Most stars actually have poege5 (~82,000 out of total 84,000). I didn't make any cuts on radial velocity error and also don't make any other cuts e.g on magnitude so you can make your own choices. 

There is a column called "derived_labels_group" which assigns the stars in this sample to the different substructures according to the clustering on the RVS halo sample within 2.5kpc (i.e. the same sample but with quality cuts), 
this is the same as the one in the DR3 clustering paper. I assign stars in our sample to the clustering groups using the Mahalanobis distance of ~80% as we did previously, D = 2.13.
